  "brief": "For the week ending 2023-09-16, United States recorded 37,874 all-cause deaths, which is 4.31 standard deviations below the 4-week rolling mean of 51,351. In CDC mortality surveillance, a strongly negative Z-score in the most recent weeks is characteristic of data reporting lag \u2014 death certificates are still being processed and have not yet been fully counted, not a genuine mortality decline. Do not act on this figure as a real trend; validate the reporting pipeline and reassess in 4 to 6 weeks when the data matures (this dataset contains 30 prior CRITICAL events across 58 total anomalies)."
